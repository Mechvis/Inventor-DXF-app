        What is an Add-In?
	</h2>
    <p class="normal">
        Inventor's Add-In functionality is a way for a program to connect to Inventor and
        use it's API. The other common ways of accessing Inventor's API are from Inventor's
        VBA and from an external exe. All of these are valid ways of using Inventor's API
        and each has their own advantages and disadvantages. Which one to use will depend
        on what your program needs to do and how it will be used by the end-user. Add-ins
        are typically used in the case where you want to add new functionality to Inventor
        in the form of custom commands. Add-in's have the following capabilities that make
        them ideal for this.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add-ins are loaded automatically when Inventor is started. This simple action provides
            some powerful capabilities. First, once an add-in has been installed on a computer,
            the user doesn't need to do anything special or know anything about programming
            to be able to access the capabilities it provides. Second, it allows the add-in
            to add its user-interface into Inventor's, i.e. ribbon buttons, browser tabs, etc.
            Third, the add-in can connect to events to monitor and respond to user activity
            in Inventor. </li>
        <li>Add-ins run in-process to Inventor, providing much better performance than an external
            exe. </li>
        <li>Add-ins can be written in any of the most popular languages so you're not limited
            to using a language you're not familiar with or that may be outdated but can take
            advantage of the latest programming technologies available. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="normal">
        To create an add-in you'll need to use Visual Studio. 
        It's possible to create an add-in using any language that supports creating
        a dll COM component, but all of the samples and tools provided with the SDK are limited to Visual Basic,
        C#, and C++. It's possible to create add-ins using the free Express editions but with some severe limitations.
        For example, debugging is not possible in Visual Basic Express 2010.  Because of this the
        professional version is recommended. The Express editions are adequate for developing standalone
        executable and are an excellent choice for getting started with Inventor's API.  But for add-in
        development you should plan on Visual Studio Professional.  The choice to use one
        of the other versions of Visual Studio with more features than the Professional
        version would be solely based on your needs and is not a requirement of Inventor.
    </p>
    <p class="normal">
        For the next step, use the <b>Inventor Add-In</b> template in Visual Studio to create
        your add-in. In order to use the add-in template you'll need to install the SDK
        DeveloperTools.msi. The location and installation instructions for the
        SDK is described in the <a href="UsingSDK.htm" data-topic-id="GUID-6FD7AA08-1E43-43FC-971B-5F20E56C8846">Introduction to Using Inventor's Programming
            Interface</a> overview.</p>
    <p>
        With the add-in wizards installed, you can create a new project in Visual Studio selecting
        the <b>Autodesk Inventor * AddIn</b> template as shown below. On the creation dialog you should choose "All*" the the filters to see all of the available templates(custom templates are not displayed for specific filter).</p>
        <center><p>
            
                <img src="../images/AddInCreateFromTemplate.png" alt="" />
        </p></center>
        <p class="normal">
            The project that's created using the template is a skeleton add-in. When Inventor
            starts your add-in it begins by calling the Activate method, which is shown in the
            picture below. A critical thing happens in this call, an object is passed to your
            add-in through the addInSite argument of the Activate method. This object supports
            an Application property which your add-in can use to gain access to Inventor's Application
            object and the entire API. You'll notice that the template is assigning the reference
            returned by the Application property to a local member variable so the add-in can
            maintain a reference to the Application object. It's also typically in the Activate
            method where your add-in will add its user interface to the Inventor's user interface
            using Inventor's API. It will also connect to any events that it needs to monitor.
            Once it's been loaded and is running the add-in doesn't do anything except react
            to events as they occur. For example, it would respond to the click when the user
            clicks one of its custom commands.</p>
            <center><p>
                
                    <img src="../images/AddInActivate.png" alt="" />
            </p></center>
            <p class="normal">
            To quickly test that the use of the add-in template resulted in the creation of
            a working add-in you can compile the project as-is. This will compile your add-in
            as a dll. The next step is to make your add-in known to Inventor.</p>
            <h3>
                Making Your Add-In Known to Inventor</h3>
            <p class="normal">
                Every time Inventor starts it looks for add-ins that have been installed and loads
                them. In previous versions before Inventor 2012 it used the registry to find the add-ins.
                This registry-based look-up is still supported for legacy add-ins, but a new registry-free
                method of making your add-in known to Inventor is now supported and is the recommended
                approach to use. When an add-in is created using the add-in template a registry-free
                add-in is created.</p>
                    <p class="normal">
                        In order to allow your add-in to be found by Inventor, you need to place a special
                        file in one of a few different directories. This file describes your add-in and
                        also indicates where your add-in dll is on the computer. When Inventor is started,
                        it scans these directories and reads these files to determine which add-ins should
                        be loaded.</p>
                    <p class="normal">
                        The file that Inventor looks for has a <i>.addin</i> extension. A .addin file was
                        automatically created for you when you created your add-in project, as is illustrated
                        below.</p>
                    <center><p>
                        
                            <img src="../images/AddInDirectory.png" alt="" />
                    </p></center>
                    <p>
                        The conents of the .addin file are shown below. As you can see it uses xml to format
                        the data.</p>

        <div class="indent">
            <p>
                <b>Addin</b> - (Required) The outermost element to involve all other elements. The Type attribute specifies the addin type, valid values are "Standard" and "Translator".</p>
            <p>
                <b>ClassId</b> - (Required) Specifies the ClassId GUID associated with an Add-in. 
                This may or may not change from one release to the next. If you look at your add-in
                code you'll see this specified as a GuidAttribute for your add-in class. In almost
                all cases you don't need to do anything with this but use what is provided.</p>
            <p>
                <b>ClientId</b> - (Required) Specifies a GUID that is used as the add-in identifier.  
                This value should remain unchanged across releases and different versions of the 
                add-in.  This value is used to identify the owner of API-created objects such as 
                ribbons, toolbars, etc. In almost all cases this will be the same as the ClassId.</p>
            <p>
                <b>DisplayName</b> - (Required) Specifies the display name of the add-in as it will 
                appear in the Add-in manager. The Language attribute can  be specified for local languages, if not specified it defaults to English, below example  sets the DisplayName for French: </p>

            <p>
                <b>Description</b> - (Required) This is a description of your add-in and is displayed in the
                bottom of the Add-In Manager dialog when the add-in is selected from the list. The Language attribute can  be specified for local languages, if not specified it defaults to English, below example  sets the Description for  French: </p>
                 <div class=indent>

            <p>
                <b>Assembly</b> - This is the path to you add-ins dll.  This can be a full path or a relative path
                where it's relative to the location of your .addin file.  It can also be relative to the Inventor\bin
                directory however since you're not allowed to install into that directory with Administrator privileges
                it's not recommended that you use that directory.  A path relative to the location of the .addin
                file is recommended and is discussed in more detail below.</p>
            <p>
                <b>OSType</b> - (Optional) Specifies if your add-in will work with only a 64 or 32 bit operating system.
                Valid values for this are "Win32" or "Win64".  If this value is not specified it's assumed the add-in is 
                assumed to be valid for both.</p>
            <p>
                <b>LoadAutomatically</b> - (Optional) Specifies whether the add-in should be allowed to load automatically 
                as per the load behaviors defined by the add-in. Value can be 0 or 1. Assumed to be true (1) if this value 
                is not specified. If set to false (0), the add-in needs to be manually loaded using the add-in manager.</p>
            <p>
                <b>LoadBehavior</b> - (Optional) Specifies when the add-in should be loaded in Inventor. This is important 
                for better startup performance. This option can be specified using one of the following values:<br />
                <div class=indent>
                0 -   Load immediately on startup <b>(not recommended)</b><br />
                1 -   Load when any document is opened<br />
                1 -   Load when a part document is opened (same as previous)<br />
                2 -   Load when an assembly document is opened<br />
                3 -   Load when a presentation document is opened<br />
                4 -   Load when a drawing document is opened<br />
                10 - Load only on demand, either through the API or using the Add-In Manager.<br /><br />
                Assumed to be <b>0</b> if this value is not specified.
                </div>
            <p>
                <b>UserUnloadable</b> - (Optional) Specifies whether the add-in should be allowed to load automatically 
                as per the load behaviors defined by the add-in. Value can be 0 or 1. Assumed to be true (1) if this value 
                is not specified. If set to false (0), the add-in needs to be manually loaded using the add-in manager.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Hidden</b> - (Optional) Specifies whether the add-in should be hidden in the Add-in Manager’s list of 
                add-ins. Assumed to be false if this value is not specified (i.e. add-in is visible). Value can be 0 or 1.</p>

                SupportedSoftwareVersionNotEqualTo </b> - (Optional) Specifies the version(s) of Inventor that the add-in should 
                be available in. Combinations of these can be used. These values are ignored if the manifest file is located in 
                a version-specific folder.Versions are declared in the format of Major#.Minor#.ServicePack# / or BuildIdentifier#. SupportedSoftwareVersionEqualTo and SupportedSoftwareVersionNotEqualTo support multiple version entries seperated by a semicolon (;).</p>
            <p>
                <b>DataVersion</b> - (Optional) Specifies the version of add-in data contained within Inventor documents that
                this version of the add-in supports. This is used by add-ins that store migrating data in Inventor documents, 
                which is indicated by the "DocumentInterests" set on the document.</p>
            <p>
                <b>UserInterfaceVersion</b> - (Optional) Specifies the version of the add-in's user interface.  Changing 
                this version results in all of the add-in’s UI getting cleaned up during Inventor start-up.</p>

<h3>
    Where to Put Your Files</h3>
            <p class="normal">
                Now that you have your add-in dll and have created your .addin file you need to know where to place those files
                so that Inventor can find and load your add-in.</p>
    <p class="Normal">
        The following four locations are supported. You can choose any one of the four depending
        on the needs of your add-in.  Your .addin file can exist in any one of the following four
        locations or any subdirectory.  The "%XXXX%" portion of each of the 
        paths is an operating system defined variable. When using Explorer you can

There are a couple of things to consider when determining where to put your add-in.  If you choose
a location that is available to all users it will require administrator privileges to install your
add-in.  In most cases, computers are rarely shared amongst multiple users so a per-user installation
is usually sufficient.</p>
<p>
If you plan on actively updating your add-in for each release of Inventor then making it version dependent
can be good so that the user will only have access to an add-in that was written for and tested with the
version of Inventor they're using.  Because significant effort is made to allow the API to be upward compatible
you should be able to run older add-ins with newer versions of Inventor.  Because of this you can supply
and add-in and not tie it to a specific version assuming that it will continue to run as newer versions of
Inventor are released.</p>
<p>
Also, because you can specify versions that your add-in is compatible within the .addin file you can still
use a version independent .addin location and control the versioning through the .addin file.

            <h3>
                Drag and Drop Add-In Deployment</h3>
                <p class="Normal">
                A new feature added in Inventor 2013 is the ability to create an add-in that can be deployed by
                simply copying a directory into a certain location on the user's computer.  The change made to
                enable this is that Inventor looks in the four directories above for .addin file and now also looks
                in any subdirectories within those four directories. If you create a directory that contains your
                .addin file and your addin dll and set the Assembly element of your .addin file to have just the
                name of your dll without any path, you can copy that folder to any of the folders above and
                Inventor will find and load your addin.  Below is an example of the directories and files for an add-in named "MyAddin".  This
                shows the full path for the "%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins" location.
                </p>

                            <img src="../images/AddInDirectories1.png" alt="" /></p></center>

<p>
It's also possible to create much more complex configurations for a drag and drop type of add-in.  For example you can have an
add-in where you have one dll for 32-bit and another one for 64-bit.  You might also have a dll that is specific to a certain
version of Inventor and a different dll for another Inventor version.  The possible directory structure to support this is
shown below.  In order for it to support multiple versions of Inventor you must put the folder in one of the two version 
independent folders. An example of how the folders might look for an add-in like this is demonstrated in the picture below.
What's happening here is that you are essentially delivering four different add-ins, each with their own .addin file and dll. Which
version and which OS the add-ins load is controlled by the contents of the .addin file for each of the add-ins.

                        <center><p>
                            <img src="../images/AddInDirectories2.png" alt="" /></p></center>
</p>
<h3>
    Debugging Your Add-In</h3>
    <p class="Normal">Once you've compiled your add-in and have a dll you'll need to follow the steps below in order to enable debugging.
    With registry-free add-ins there isn't any difference between debugging with 32 or 64-bit Inventor. 
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    You need to copy your .addin file and the add-in dll into one of the locations where Inventor looks for .addin files, as described 
    above. This allows Inventor to find your add-in.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need to change setting in your project so that when you compile your project, the dll is output to the directory above.  This
    is so Visual Studio and Inventor will be using the same dll.  The project setting to change is shown below.
                        <center><p>
                            <img src="../images/AddInOutputPath.png" alt="" /></p></center>
    </li>
    <li>
    You need to set the debug setting so that when you start your project from Visual Studio it will automatically start Inventor.
    The project setting to change is shown below.
                        <center><p>
                            <img src="../images/AddInDebugStartInventor.png" alt="" /></p></center>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="normal">Now you can add break points to your add-in and begin debugging (F5) from Visual Studio.  Inventor should begin running and
    your break points should be hit when those lines are executed.</p>
<h3>
    Writing Your Add-In Code</h3>
    <p class="Normal">The actual code of your add-in isn't anything specific to an add-in but uses the Inventor API to interact with
    Inventor.  The only thing that's somewhat unique to an add-in is that some API calls have an argument for a <i>ClientId</i>.  This is
    the ClientID of your add-in as identified in your .addin file.  This is typically used when you're creating user-interface elements
    in Inventor.  Inventor uses this to remember which add-in created what.
