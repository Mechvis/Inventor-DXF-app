          Description
        </h2>
    <p class="api">Method that returns simple linear geometry that represents the display geometry of the annotation.&nbsp;The result is returned as groups of connected lines (polylines).&nbsp;Groups can optionally be filled with internal voids.</p>
    <h2 class="api">
            Remarks
          </h2>Below is an example of a feature control symbol.&nbsp;Like most annotations it consists of some geometry and some text.&nbsp;This method only returns the geometry which is shown in black below.&nbsp;You can get the textual information separately in one of two ways, as a description of the text or as graphics that represent the display of the text.&nbsp;As a description of the text you can use properties on the various annotations to determine the text that’s displayed.&nbsp;For the raw text graphics, use the GetDisplayText method.
<center><img src="../Images/GetDisplayGeometryExample.png"></center>
For the above example, Below are each of the arguments and the values returned along with a brief description of the value.
GroupCount = 4, In this example each character or symbol is a group, but this shouldn’t be expected in all cases.&nbsp;For example a group defines a filled area and voids within that area.&nbsp;A character that has disjoint filled areas like a percent sign <b>%</b> will be returned as three groups since there are three filled areas.&nbsp;Unfilled shapes can be returned as a group of multiple polylines or several groups each containing a single polyline.&nbsp;The geometry described is the same and no expectation should be made about how it’s presented.

<b>PolylinesPerGroup</b>
(0) = 2
(1) = 3
(2) = 1
(3) = 3
The number of polylines within each group is specified with this argument, where a polyline is equivalent to a loop.
<br />
<b>FilledGroups</b>
(0) = True, The “A” is filled
(1)	= True, The “B” is filled
(2)	= True, The “C” is filled
(3)	= False, the center symbol is not filled
<br />
<b>PolylineCount</b>
The polyline count is 9 in this case.&nbsp;This is the total number of polylines.&nbsp;This can also be computed by adding up the values returned by the PolylinesPerGroup argument.
<br />
<b>PolylineLengths</b>
(0) = 9, The outer shape of the “A”
(1) = 4, The inner shape of the “A”
(2) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “B”
(3) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “B”
(4) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “B”
(5) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “C”
(6) = Many points because of the circle in the center symbol.
(7) = 2, One of the lines of the center symbol.
(8) = 2, The other line of the center symbol.
<br />
<b>VertexCount</b>
The VertexCount is many and cannot be pre-determined because curves and arcs are stroked into line segments.
<br />
<b>VertexCoordinates</b>
The number vertex coordinates is VertexCount * 3, These are the x,y,z coordintes of the vertices in model space.
<br /><br />
Here’s another simpler example without any curves.

<b>GroupCount</b>
The GroupCount is 4 because each box is a logical group.
<b>PolylinesPerGroup</b>
(0) = 1
(1) = 1
(2) = 2
(3) = 3
The number of polylines within each group is specified with this argument, where a polyline is equivalent to a loop.
<br />
<b>FilledGroups</b>
(0) = True, The first shape is filled
(1) = False, The second shape is not filled
(2) = False, The third shape is not filled
(3) = True, the fourth shape is filled
<br />
<b>PolylineCount</b>
The polyline count is 7 and is the total number of polylines in all groups.
<br />
<b>PolylineLengths</b>
(0) = 4, The number of segments in the first shape.
(1) = 4, The number of segments in the second shape.
(2) = 4, The number of segments in the outer loop of the third shape.
(3) = 4, The number of segments in the inner loop of the third shape.
(4) = 4, The number of segments in the outer loop of the fourth shape.
(5) = 4, The number of segments in the first inner loop of the fourth shape.
(6) = 4, The number of segments in the second inner loop of the fourth shape.
<br />
<b>VertexCount</b>
The vertex count is 35.&nbsp;There are 7 rectangles in the image above.&nbsp;Each polyline is represented by 5 points since the first and last coordinate is repeated for a closed shape.&nbsp;This results in 35 vertices.
<br />
<b>VertexCoordinates</b>	
(0) = 0.0, x coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1
(1) = 0.0, y coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1
(2) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1
(3) = 1.0, x coordinate of the 2nd vertex of shape 1
(4) = 0.0, y coordinate of the 2nd vertex of shape 1
(5) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 2nd vertex of shape 1
(6) = 1.0, x coordinate of the 3rd vertex of shape 1
(7) = 1.0, y coordinate of the 3rd vertex of shape 1
(8) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 3rd vertex of shape 1
(9) = 0.0, x coordinate of the 4th vertex of shape 1
(10) = 1.0, y coordinate of the 4th vertex of shape 1
(11) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 4th vertex of shape 1
(12) = 0.0, x coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1 (repeat)
(13) = 0.0, y coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1 (repeat)
(14) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1 (repeat)
(15) = 1.5, x coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 2
(16) = 0.0, y coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 2
(17) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 2<h2 class="api">
